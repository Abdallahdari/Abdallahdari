## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abdallah, and I am a Full Stack Developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HAntiiye System 
ðŸ‘¯ One of the projects I have worked on and completed is Dalab E-commerce, an online shopping platform. I built the frontend using Next.js and React, and used Supabase for the backend. The platform has two main phases: one for users and another for admins.


â€¢ User phase: https://production-version.vercel.app/
â€¢ Admin phase: https://dashboard-dalab.vercel.app/
